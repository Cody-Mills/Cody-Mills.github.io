        <br>
        Office Overtime is a arcade style endurance game where the goal is to survive as long as possible. 
        You are playing as Gary's guardian angel and it is your job to keep him safe.
        Gary is under high stress at the office, that's no good as that stress is manifesting itself as monsters who are after Gary's life. 
        Use your abilities to defend Gary from these monsters who are attacking him without him even being aware of their presence. 
        Designed to be played with just a mouse or a touchscreen switch between your three tools to defeat the on-comming swarms of monsters, each monster can only be harmed from specific attacks so make sure to be switching weapons constantly.

                This game was developed in the Godot game engine for PC, web and mobile.
                This is actually not the first version of this game, this game was originally developed as a simple top down shooter in Unity for a University class as a compromise for time, but the game was originally visioned to play like how it does in this version.
                I developed this game solo so all the programming and art was done by me. 
                The part I am most proud of from this game is some of the shaders and animations I made for it, I believe it is some of my best visuals yet. 
                In particular I am really proud of the games death animation, the GIF below shows this animation.

                <h1>
                So I made the hard decision to abandon this game so far into development after all that time investment for a few reasons. 
                The first reason is poor planning, it took several months for me to realise the game was not fun. 
                I didn't make a game design document for this game, nor did I do much planning for how the game-loop would actually play, I supposed I thought I would just figure it out.
                Unfortunately, I never figured it out.
                So several months in I found out that the game I made was directionless and not fun and the amount of effort and time it would take to transform what is there into something fun is just too high to justify.
                There was two major steps I could have taken to have prevented this outcome and that would have been to make a game design document with a concrete plan of the game-loop before touching any code, and second, make a prototype of the game as soon as possible.
                Due to this being a revival of a previous project I was distracted updating all the visuals and trying to make the game look good which prevented me from making a core prototype first to see the game working first, which ultimately lead to this disaster.
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though it hurts to quit so far into this project I think it makes the most sense and who knows I might return to it at one point. 
                From what this project lacks in direction and fun, it does serve as a great learning experience for me and my game developer journey, I will now always make sure to plan and make a game design document first to see if the game concept actually bears any fruit first. 
                I will also ensure that when I do start a project that I make a prototype as soon as possible, ignoring any and all visuals and just ensuring that the game will actually be fun.

                <h1>
                    Overall, I am still really happy with the visuals of the game, and the code in the game is very clean and robust and designed to be very modular which is all great, but none of that matters as it is not fun to play.
                    This game will serve as a fun memory in the future, but likely nothing more than that.
