    <p>Computer Games Programmer</p>
    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a Computer Games Programmer with a passion for video games and a desire to make my mark in the industry.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Games Programmer who has a deep passion and love for video games as a whole and I want to make my mark on the industry working on interesting and unique games to further push the art. In my spare time, I work on small games, currently working on two. I am looking for a programming placement position at a games company and hope to get my start in the industry.</p>
        <p>I have experience primarily in C++ & the Godot Game engine, but I have also made small games and tools with other languages and engines such as C# & the Unity Game engine. The most important skill for programming to me is the ability to always keep learning and adapting what you know; it can always be more efficient.</p>
