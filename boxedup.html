        You play as an employee of a Postal Service Company where you are working late shifts in isolation, with your only human interaction being your boss on the radio. You start to discover that there is something wrong with the packages comming in, they seem to contain these strange creatures. These monsters are disguising themselves as packages so it is your job to notice the inconsistancies on their packaging to find the monsters and incinerate them.

                This game was built in Unreal Engine 5.4. The game was part of a small collabrative team of 26 people with me being one of the 6 programmers. I was a Junior Programmer on this project and it was my first experience with such a large project with so many people working on it. 
                I found the experience working on this project to be a very good learning experience for: my technical knowledge, experience with Unreal Engine, working in a team and working with other disciplines like Designers & Artists. 
                <br>
            <h4>
                This project was developed using no AI. All assets were custom made for the game by the talented team.
                <br>
                Developed from 10th March 2025 - 13th May 2025.

                <h1>
                My Role in this games development was to mostly develop the game A.I for the little monsters in the game. This system would allow the designers to place monster spawners in the Game World, the monster would choose one of the spawners to spawn at, then it would check around itself
                for the nearest Machine to its' current position and disable it. Then it would audibly taunt the player until the player defeats them by picking them up and throwing them. This system was made up of a lot of smaller considerations, for example: when defeating the monster, should 
                they die everytime they are thrown no matter the speed thrown? What would happen if the player just taps the grab button on the monster and then leaves them? What if the monster gets stuck outside the players view? These were just some of the considertions that had to be made for 
                each component of these monsters.

                    Overall, I am extremely proud of this project and could not be more greatful for how fortunate I was to get such a motivated and talanted team. 
                    If there was anything I regret from this project it would be that the monsters could be more physically present in the game as outside of the monsters that appear on the desks you dont see them.
                    When it comes to my personal thoughts on my performance I believe that I was a good teammate for this project but the main thing I could improve is my working stamina.
                    I found myself working significantly harder and better in the earlier and later weeks of the project but had a lacking few weeks in the middle so that is something I will try to improve on for future projects.
