        You play as an employee of a Postal Service Company where you are working late shifts in isolation, with your only human interaction being your boss on the radio. You start to discover that there is something wrong with the packages comming in, they seem to contain these strange creatures. These monsters are disguising themselves as packages so it is your job to notice the inconsistancies on their packaging to find the monsters and incinerate them.
        You can play the game on  <a href="https://sebastian-lucker.itch.io/boxed-up">Itch.io here. </a></p>

                This game was built in Unreal Engine 5.4. The game was part of a small collabrative team of 26 people with me being one of the 6 programmers. I was a Junior Programmer on this project and it was my first experience with such a large project with so many people working on it. 
                I found the experience working on this project to be a very good learning experience for: my technical knowledge, experience with Unreal Engine, working in a team and working with other disciplines like Designers & Artists.

                My Role in this games development was to mostly develop the game A.I for the little monsters in the game. This system would allow the designers to place monster spawners in the Game World, the monster would choose one of the spawners to spawn at, then it would check around itself
                for the nearest Machine to its' current position and disable it. Then it would audibly taunt the player until the player defeats them by picking them up and throwing them. This system was made up of a lot of smaller considerations, for example: when defeating the monster, should 
                they die everytime they are thrown no matter the speed thrown? What would happen if the player just taps the grab button on the monster and then leaves them? What if the monster gets stuck outside the players view? These were just some of the considertions that had to be made for 
                each component of these monsters.
